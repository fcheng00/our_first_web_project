            <p>In Minecraft, a sword deals a lot of damage and is the most used. There are different
                kinds of swords. Some people have bow and arrows. They are good ranged weapons to
                kill creepers.

            <h2>Armor</h2>
            <hr />
            <span>Armor is a way to give yourself more hitpoints.</span>
            <span>There are classic armor and other ones like a turtle shell.</span>
            <span>Some things you wear don't give extra hp, like a pumpkin helmet.</span>
            <span>They prevent Endermen from attacking you.</span>
            <h3>Getting armor</h3>
            <!-- This is an alternative to the p tag, but it is not good in real sites, only your own 
                    stuff. Still, don't do it. This is block level text -->
            Usually, you get armor by crafting or collecting it. Diamond armor is especially hard to
            get.
