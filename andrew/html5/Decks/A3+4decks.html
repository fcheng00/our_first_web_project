                        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                        <span>This deck is one that I made out of a few combos, like Giant + Witch, Baby 
                            dragon + Cannon defence, and Giant + support.
                        </span>
                        <span>This deck is 3.6, so it should have a good time on the ladder.</span>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Card roles</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Giant-This is your main tank so use it wisely for pushes! Use Giant Witch for a 
                                huge devestating push. Also, you can pair it with the Baby dragon or Bomber to 
                                demolish Skeleton armies blocking your path. Also, start with the Giant in the 
                                very back so that you can gain elixir while it walks up to the bridge.
                            </li>
                            <li>Witch-This is a great spawner, spawning 4 skeletons every 7 seconds. When you 
                                use it behind a Giant, you can strip down their ground and air alike. You can 
                                use this also to defence and counter lone Baby dragons, Princes, Giants, 
                                Mini P.E.K.K.A.s, and many more single target cards. When spawned behind the 
                                King tower, it can spawn nearly a Skeleton army and attack the tower behind a 
                                Giant.
                            </li>
                            <li>Skeletons-Cheap distraction, cycle card, and 67 dps times 3 which is like 5,000 
                                dps with this card, don't check my math, all just for... 1 ELIXIR!?!?!?! Just at 
                                tournament standards(level 9)!!! But this card is pretty much only for defending 
                                Giants and building targeting only ground troops in ladder other than reasons 
                                said above.
                            </li>
                            <li>Lightning-For y'all new Arena 4 players, lighning might seem great and easy to 
                                use at first and that is true. Lightning is good, but once you play for a while, 
                                you'll find out that it is not very easy to use after all. You see, the 
                                Lightning only targets 3 troops, buildings, or Crown towers with the most 
                                health, so if there is a Witch and four summoned Skeletons and the tower is at 
                                two health, then the lightning will only hit the Witch and 2 Skeletons even 
                                though the tower was in the radius of the lightning because the Lightning hit 
                                the things with most health. To avoid this, aim the lightning on only the 
                                tower and not the Witch so that the tower is destroyed. The Lightning is good 
                                for taking out:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Musketeers!</li>
                                    <li>Witches!</li>
                                    <li>Battle ram!</li>
                                    <li>Kight if Lightning is overleveled</li>
                                    <li>And any fireballies that is not more than three.</li>
                                </ul>
                                But there are some cards that are not worth Striking. Like Spear goblins or 
                                Minions because it is too much of a negative elixir trade and they can be 
                                Arrowed or Zapped and left to the tower. However, if you get the tower with a 
                                P.E.K.K.A. and a baby dragon and the tower, it won't kill any of them, but you 
                                dealt massive damage and can leave it all to Musketeer to kill both troops. 
                                Also, go Lightning spawners like Goblin hut because then it will spawn less 
                                Goblins, decreasing the value and you should try to hit the Princess tower too.
