                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>This is a deck with only one Arena 7 card, so you can subsitute the Guards for the Goblins if you 
                            are Arena 6. Its basically the same. Other than that, all you need to know is that you can 
                            play defensive, but you need to go aggresive with P.E.K.K.A. Ram during double elixir and 
                            sudden death.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Card roles</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>P.E.K.K.A.-this is your main tank and can be used mostly in offence but sometimes for 
                                defence as a tank killer(to kill Royal giant, Skeleton giant, or Giant) when there is not 
                                a better quick choice. To support it on offence, do bats or Minions but only charge 
                                during double elixir. One hit from this beast will cripple the towers so make sure it 
                                gets to the towers.
                            </li>
                            <li>Battle ram-your win condition. Let it hit the tower. You win if it does. Thats all.</li>
                            <li>Goblin barrel-throw it at the tower. Then the corner near the tower. Then back. Back 
                                and forth does it. They will be CONFUSED for like the whole match and rage quit. Because 
                                they cannot hit it with Arrows or Fireball!
                            </li>
                            <li>Minions-this is a good DPS card. Use it wisely against the Balloon and the Skeleton 
                                giant. It counters the Mega minions. It counters the Valkyrie. It counters alot. But don't 
                                use it against something only on ground and weak air. You can use it against seige and air 
                                decks like X-bow Mortar tower attack at the bridge, Skeleton barrel, and Lavahound.
                            </li>
                            <li>Bats-these Bats are really just defensive minions that are better against single target 
                                troops like Mega minion and other troops like P.E.K.K.A. Just watch out for Zap and 
                                Arrows and you will be able to stop alot with bats.
                            </li>
                            <li>Guards-use them for defence. Use them against Skeleton barrel and Prince. Use it against 
                                a Mini P.E.K.K.A. or a Knight. Use them the same as Goblins, just that they have a 
                                shield and one huge hit from a Prince will kill only the shield and not touch the 
                                Guard. Counter the Guards with Valkyrie or Minions or Spear goblins.
                            </li>
                            <li>Arrows-use them against any small Minion, Skeleton, small Goblin, Bat, anything Zappable, 
                                Even Flying machines! You can Arrow the tower if it has less than 50 health. Go Arrows!
                            </li>
                            <li>Wizard-spash! Damage! Destroy! Make them rage quit!! The Wizard has so much value!</li>
                        </ul>
