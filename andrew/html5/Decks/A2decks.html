                        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                        <span>This deck is a fun beatdown deck that can also be used for defence until double 
                            elixir.
                        </span>
                        <span>As you can see, this deck has troops only Skeleton or Goblin related.(except 
                            Fireball) This deck got me through late-Arena 2 and early-Arena 3 battles 
                            with a few changes.
                        </span>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Card roles</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spear goblins-they are the main air defence as well as support troops, but 
                                they are highly recommended for defence because you know, they are one of 
                                the only air defence troops. If you insist on using Spear goblins on 
                                offence, just know they can't do lot's 'o damage.(Only chip damage)
                            </li>
                            <li>Bomber-this is your cheap area damage and horde killer. You should never 
                                use him for minions, because he only attacks ground troops, not air troops. 
                                When countering this troop, be sure to use a spell like fireball and use a 
                                Mini P.E.K.K.A. or ranged single troop.(MUSKETEER! HUNTER! BABY DRAGON!) 
                                also, don't use Skeleton army since the bomber can DEMOLISH Skeleton army 
                                in seconds!(and use Bomber against Skeleton armies hacking at your tanks!)
                            </li>
                            <li>Skeleton giant-This is your main win condition. He is a tank and when he 
                                dies, He drops a bomb that does 800+ damage that kills most mini-tanks and 
                                support troops. He is a great troop to launch a suicide attack on 
                                Barbrarians and Witch. For damage on the tower, make a distraction on one 
                                lane and Skeleton giant the other.
                            </li>
                            <li>Skeleton army-use it to kill any tank without Bomber or Valkyrie support. 
                                You can also use it to surround Goblin barrels and mini-tanks. It is also 
                                good for killing Giants before they get to the tower, but if there are 
                                support troops, the Giant might get a few hits. Basically, defence only.
                            </li>
                            <li>Witch-She is your only other air damage troop. Remember: she can be 
                                crippled by a Fireball, so spawn her at the back to have more spawned 
                                Skeletons. Use her as defence, as she has not much offensive value. The 
                                skeletons won't get the tower and the tower might kill the Witch before 
                                she can shoot alot. Also, because she is one of your only air defence, 
                                spawn her against Prince and Baby dragons.
                            </li>
                            <li>Wall breakers-are they Bombers or are they normal Skeletons? Use them for 
                                attacking and if the enemy spawns a cannon, launch the Wall breakers. They 
                                cripple or kill the cannon for an elixer advantage. Also use them for 
                                attacking towers, because if there is no interference, they can deal alot 
                                of damage.
                            </li>
                            <li>Goblin barrel-How do three Goblins even fit in there? This card is a 
                                spell to deal chip damage or distract the tower for a push. A strategy is 
                                to first place is right on the tower so that the Goblins spread out. The 
                                enemy will likely Arrows or Fireball the Goblins. The next time, throw 
                                them into the corner so that the spell misses.(and gives you a good 
                                elixir advantage!)
                            </li>
                            <li>Fireball-Just Fireball all moderate health things so that the thing is 
                                dead or crippled. Fireball everything up to Arena 2 except Giant and 
                                Skeleton giant. Also, don't Fireball a king tower, because it will 
                                activate the tower, so that the towers will kill your troops twice as 
                                fast! Yikes! (a tip from arena 11: don't fireball Tesla when it is 
                                underground. It does no damage. Only EQ/Earthquake damages the 
                                underground Tesla.)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Strategy</h3>
                        <h4>Early game</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use the Witch to test out your enemy's spells or troops. So say you lured 
                                a Skeleton army, then you would know that you could use a Bomber for 
                                defence a lot.
                            </li>
                            <li>You might use a Skeleton giant at the beginning. It forces a response, 
                                but it might be fatal because they will launh a counter attack that can't 
                                be beaten before it lands hits on the tower. Even though the Skeleton 
                                giant's bomb will get the enemy, the enemy can still deal a lot of 
                                damage, so it is not recommended.
                            </li>
                            <li>Goblin barrel is a good card to use with Wall breakers. First, place 
                                Goblin barrel in the far corner. Then, do Wall breakers at the bridge. If 
                                the enemy doesn't think of it as much, this could possibly do 500+ to 
                                1000+ damage!!!
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Mid-game</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Play more aggresively with the Skeleton giant and support it with Bobmer 
                                or Witch. The tower will lock on to the Skeleton giant, allowing the 
                                support troop to deal massive damage.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The Witch can very easily deal tower damage due to her long range, 
                                        but the skeletons are the actual ones that deal the majority of 
                                        the damage.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>A bomber can wipe out Skeleton armies and ground hordes. Don't be 
                                        mistaken: It can do a lot of damage to the tower too!
                                    </li>
                                    <li>This is not a push at the beginning because they can just do a 
                                        cannon or a spawner and push the other side. If they do so, then 
                                        FIREBALL IT IMMEDIATELY!
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Watch the opponent's cards. If they have only one building, Wait for them 
                                to use it. Then, do Skeleton giant. Support it if you can and maybe 
                                you'll even get the tower. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Late-game</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Due to the double elixir, use the Skeleton giant and Witch a lot. They 
                                can be used to force a reaction out of the enemy, instead of gathering 
                                elixir for a push. That can make the opponent use the cards they want to 
                                use for a push.
                            </li>
                            <li>Something fun would be a Goblin barrel and a skeleton army for offence. 
                                The tower would lock on to the Goblins, allowing your Skeleton army to 
                                easily rush to the tower.
                            </li>
                            <li>Push with everything. Play crazy and don't allow the enemy to attack.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Main counters and how to deal with them</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Baby dragon-this is a huge counter and it can cripple your Bomber, Wall 
                                breakers, Witch, Skeleton army, and Goblin barrel. The way to counter it 
                                is to surround ot with Spear goblins and then do Witch. Or, just do a 
                                Fireball at it.
                            </li>
                            <li>Valkyrie-it is effective against mostly everything in this deck. Fireball 
                                it and it should only get one hit on the tower max.
                            </li>
