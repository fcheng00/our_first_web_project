                        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                        <p>This is a great deck for double elixir so it should be good for defending until more 
                            elixir comes. Giant + Witch is a great combo with Baby dragon and spells so it is a 
                            great deck to use.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Card roles</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Giant-This is your main tank so use it wisely for pushes! Use Giant Witch for a 
                                huge devestating push. Also, you can pair it with the Baby dragon or Bomber to 
                                demolish Skeleton armies blocking your path. Also, start with the Giant in the 
                                very back so that you can gain elixir while it walks up to the bridge.
                            </li>
                            <li>Witch-This is a great spawner, spawning 4 skeletons every 7 seconds. When you 
                                use it behind a Giant, you can strip down their ground and air alike. You can 
                                use this also to defence and counter lone Baby dragons, Princes, Giants, 
                                Mini P.E.K.K.A.s, and many more single target cards. When spawned behind the 
                                King tower, it can spawn nearly a Skeleton army and attack the tower behind a 
                                Giant.
                            </li>
                            <li>Skeletons-Cheap distraction, cycle card, and 67 dps times 3 which is like 5,000 
                                dps with this card, don't check my math, all just for... 1 ELIXIR!?!?!?! Just at 
                                tournament standards(level 9)!!! But this card is pretty much only for defending 
                                Giants and building targeting only ground troops in ladder other than reasons 
                                said above.
                            </li>
                            <li>Lightning-For y'all new Arena 4 players, lighning might seem great and easy to 
                                use at first and that is true. Lightning is good, but once you play for a while, 
                                you'll find out that it is not very easy to use after all. You see, the 
                                Lightning only targets 3 troops, buildings, or Crown towers with the most 
                                health, so if there is a Witch and four summoned Skeletons and the tower is at 
                                two health, then the lightning will only hit the Witch and 2 Skeletons even 
                                though the tower was in the radius of the lightning because the Lightning hit 
                                the things with most health. To avoid this, aim the lightning on only the 
                                tower and not the Witch so that the tower is destroyed. The Lightning is good 
                                for taking out:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Musketeers!</li>
                                    <li>Witches!</li>
                                    <li>Battle ram!</li>
                                    <li>Knight if Lightning is at a higher level</li>
                                    <li>And any fireballies that is not more than three.</li>
                                </ul>
                                But there are some cards that are not worth Striking. Like Spear goblins or 
                                Minions because it is too much of a negative elixir trade and they can be 
                                Arrowed or Zapped and left to the tower. However, if you get the tower with a 
                                P.E.K.K.A. and a baby dragon and the tower, it won't kill any of them, but you 
                                Also, go Lightning spawners like Goblin hut because then it will spawn less 
                                Goblins, decreasing the value and you should try to hit the Princess tower too.
                            </li>
                            <li>Cannon-BOOM! The Cannon is here! Everyone knows that the cannon is not OP, 
                                but it actually is good and easy to use! For only 3 elixir, the Cannon can draw 
                                troops to the middle, shoot ground troops and deal moderate damage, and even 
                                snipe huts on the other side of the river that are misplaced and too close to 
                                the river! And, you can use the cannon to cycle to your Hog rider or Baby dragon. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Zap-A small spell, Zap! Zap enemy low health troops or Inferno towers will be 
                                busted by the Zap! But it does minimal damage on other things. Skeleton armies, 
                                Goblins, Inferno towers, Minions, and Minion hordes are all favorite targets of 
                                Zap in these arenas. Minions and Minion horde can be zapped and then killed by 
                                towers in one shot. Any normal skeleton or goblins/spear goblins/goblin barrels 
                                can be one shotted by Zap or the tower can one shot them. But why Zap Inferno 
                                towers? Because if it locks on to one of your high hitpoint troops, its damage 
                                will increase over time and kill the main troop in a blink of an eye. But if 
                                you Zap the tower, the damage ramp up will restart and you can quickly destroy 
                                it. ZAP!
                            </li>
                            <li>Bomber-The Bomber tactics are basic. Place it at a distance from ground swarms 
                                so that it can lob bombs and defeat ground. But it doesn't attack air so don't 
                                use it against minions! BOMBS AWAY!
                            </li>
                            <li>Baby dragon-fireball! The Baby dragon is very vertasile for air and swarm 
                                control. It is only 4 elixir so it is very quick to get the elixir and deploy 
                                it. Don't use this against high damage, single target troops or buildings like 
                                Mega minion at close range or Musketeer or Inferno tower. Hits on a tower is 
                                very powerful and if they spawn Archers next to the tower, the splash will 
                                clip the tower!
                            </li>

                        <h3>Strategy</h3>
                        <h4>Early game</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Play passive. Stay safe by defending with Cannon, Baby dragon, and Witch. 
                                Also, it is fun to Kite with giant. So, you place a Giant in the middle, on the 
                                other side of the push, maybe a P.E.K.K.A. or another strond single (slow) 
                                card. Then, the enemy card goes to kill the Giant, making it switch lanes and 
                                attack the tower that has more health if needed. But only kite if not building 
                                up for a push or just defending in the beginning or maybe in double elixir.
                            </li>
                            <li>Relax and wait for double elixir to come. Then you can play aggresive!!!</li>
                            <li>Zap all Skeleton armies and Minion hordes. Zap won't kill Minions, but it will 
                                allow the tower to one-shot the minions and not let them deal nore than one hit.
                            </li>
                            <li>Skeleton all Hog riders and Mini P.E.K.K.A.s. Place skeletons in front of tower 
                                for Hog riders and in the middle two tiles to the side of the Mini P.E.K.K.A.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Well duh... Double elixir!</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In double elixir, go for Giant Witch pushes, possibly supported by leftover 
                                troops for support. Fiant in front, Witch and skeletons behind. CHARGE!!!!!! whatever 
                                you have in rotation like cannon at bridge to help with opponent defence.

                            <li>Valkyrie-if there's one hard counter, it'll be the Valkyrie. Cannon can deal 
                                with it when placed in the middle so it can't kill the Witch. Also, don't show 
                                the Witch until the end because Valkyrie is a popular card and they'll know to

                            <li>Mega minion-the Mega minion counters the Baby dragon at close range, the Giant, 
                                the Bomber, and Cannons too close to the bridge. Lightning is good when targeting  
                                other things with the Mega minion too, so it can wipe out for good. Also, Witch 
                                is great too at further range. If they charge lone Mega minion, ignore it.

                            <li>P.E.K.K.A.-it can kill most things. Just do Witch in the middle/closer to the 
                                side the P.E.K.K.A. is on and not right next to it.
